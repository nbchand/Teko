<h1>Teko</h1>
Teko: Ride-Sharing App is built to bridge the gap between riders
and passengers. With the Teko ride-sharing app, one can easily find the available rides for the
provided source and destination. It also provides a platform for the riders to add trips seamlessly
for their source and destination of travel.
When we want to travel, first we opt for public transport. Public transport is both uncomfortable
and costly to travel. If we wanted to take our vehicle for the travel it becomes expensive to travel
alone. To resolve this problem Teko comes into the picture.
With the Teko Ride-Sharing App, users can add trips for their travel and the interested users can
contact the vehicle owner and both can share the trip on mutual agreement. This provides the
comfort of private vehicles at the cost of public transport for both.
